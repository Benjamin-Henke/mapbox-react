# Description

My Spike for my solo project is using Mapbox as my map api for users to view events within their area via an interactive map. 

## Proof of Concept

This small project was a lesson taught by Leigh Halliday (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJatzkPcmoI&t=271s). I did not fork his repo as I created the file from the beginning. Learning what is needed from the user for my database, I can use the concept learned here and apply them and customize them to fit into my project.
